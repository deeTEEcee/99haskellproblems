-- print $ last [1,2,3]
is the same as
-- print (last [1,2,3])
used for grouping expressions, just a matter of perference

// ???
Monads: use Maybe+Nothing for non-error return cases (need to understand more about this) but then we get ambiguous a0 error

// type vs data keyword (type is for synonyms where data lets you define new types)
